This is a repo for my CS5150 final project. Currently the originization is a mess so I appoglize for that.
The code I wrote for this project thus far lies in python/MCTS.py,python/TreeNode.py,python/RL.py,python/RLAgent.py and python/State.py
To run the agent first run the bash script start.sh, then run python2 python/Main_PyAIvsPyAI.py.
Note that the bash script assumes you are running linux, if you are running another OS please change the script to reflect that. 
For more info on how to set up FightingICE if the files in the repo do not work for some reason please refer to http://www.ice.ci.ritsumei.ac.jp/~ftgaic/
